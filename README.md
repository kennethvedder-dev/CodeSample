# CodeSample
## by Kenneth Vedder

This is a Unity project that showcases in a vertical slice how I tend to idealize, structure and write code. In addition to this, it also displays usage of stylization with post-processing and VFX.

It was made with version 2019.4.22 LTS and it doesn't use any plugins.

You must start with the scene "TitleScreen" to play in order.
